# duck-song

This is the alternative project I made with my template. The main project is for Ludwig's Christmas Playlist - A Very Mogul Christmas!

# Main Repo
The main repo is located [here](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding/mogul-christmas)

# Important
Ensure that the last youtube video you watched wasn't on mute, otherwise the autoplay on this site will be muted too.

# On Updates
I proably won't be updating this template, but you can view the main repo at mogul-christmas, and create a PR if you like. I'll be sure to merge it.

# Check it out here
The website is hosted [here](https://kendalldoescoding.gq/ducksong)! 

Make sure you check it out.
