# duck-song

This is the alternative project I made with my template. The main project is for Ludwig's Christmas Playlist - A Very Mogul Christmas!

The main repo is located [here](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding/mogul-christmas)

I proably won't be updating this template, but you can view the main repo at mogul-christmas, and create a PR if you like. I'll be sure to merge it.
