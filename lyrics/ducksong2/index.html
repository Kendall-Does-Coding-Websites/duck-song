 <div class="lyrics">
  <p>A duck walked up to a lemonade stand</p>
  <p>And he said to the man, running the stand</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>The man said</p>
  <p>"No we just sell lemonade. But it's cold</p>
  <p>And it's fresh</p>
  <p>And it's all home-made. Can I get you</p>
  <p>Glass?"</p>
  <p>The duck said,</p>
  <p>"I'll pass".</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day.</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum ba-bada-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand</p>
  <p>And he said to the man running the stand,</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?</p>
  <p>The man said,</p>
  <p>"No, like I said yesterday</p>
  <p>We just sell lemonade OK?</p>
  <p>Why not give it a try?"</p>
  <p>The duck said,</p>
  <p>"Goodbye."good day</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day.</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand</p>
  <p>And he said to the man running the stand,</p>
  <p>"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?</p>
  <p>The man said,</p>
  <p>Look, this is getting old.</p>
  <p>I mean, lemonade's all we've ever sold.</p>
  <p>Why not give it a go?"</p>
  <p>The duck said,</p>
  <p>"How 'bout, no."</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day.</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand</p>
  <p>And he said to the man running the stand,</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>The man said,</p>
  <p>"THAT'S IT!</p>
  <p>If you don't stay away, duck,</p>
  <p>I'll glue you to a tree and leave you there all day, stuck</p>
  <p>So don't get to close!"</p>
  <p>The duck said,</p>
  <p>"Adios."</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day.</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum ba-ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand</p>
  <p>And he said to the man that was running the stand,</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) got any glue?"</p>
  <p>"What"</p>
  <p>"Got any glue?"</p>
  <p>"No, why would Iâ€“ oh!"</p>
  <p>And one more question for you;</p>
  <p>"Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum, bum bum bum)</p>
  <p>And the man just stopped.</p>
  <p>Then he started to smile.</p>
  <p>He started to laugh.</p>
  <p>He laughed for a while.</p>
  <p>He said,</p>
  <p>"Come on duck, let's walk to the store.</p>
  <p>I'll buy you some grapes</p>
  <p>So you won't have to ask anymore."</p>
  <p>So they walked to the store</p>
  <p>And the man bought some grapes.</p>
  <p>He gave one to the duck and the duck said,</p>
  <p>"Hmmm..No thanks. But you know what sounds good?</p>
  <p>It would make my day.</p>
  <p>Do you think this store</p>
  <p>Do you think this store</p>
  <p>Do you think this store has any lemonade?"</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away.</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
