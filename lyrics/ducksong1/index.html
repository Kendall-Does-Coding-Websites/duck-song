  <p>A duck walked up to a corner store(Bum bum bum, ba-dum ba-dum)</p>
  <p>And he said to the woman, running the store</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>The woman said</p>
  <p>"No, it's a corner store</p>
  <p>I mean grapes aren't really what we're known for</p>
  <p>We've got some grape drinks?"</p>
  <p>The duck said</p>
  <p>"They kinda stink."</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the corner store</p>
  <p>And he said to the woman, running the store</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>The woman said</p>
  <p>"Oh, it's you again, duck</p>
  <p>I already told you you're out of luck</p>
  <p>I've got some grape gum?"</p>
  <p>The duck said</p>
  <p>"I'll take none."</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the corner store</p>
  <p>And he said to the woman, running the store</p>
  <p>"Hey! (bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>The woman said</p>
  <p>"Look, I'm trying not to shout</p>
  <p>But please either buy something or get out!</p>
  <p>We don't sell fruit!"</p>
  <p>The duck said</p>
  <p>"I'm kinda cute."</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the corner store</p>
  <p>And he said to the woman, running the store</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) Got any grapes?"</p>
  <p>The woman said</p>
  <p>"THAT'S IT!</p>
  <p>The next time you ask for grapes</p>
  <p>I'm gonna tape you to the wall with this duct tape</p>
  <p>Do I make myself clear?"</p>
  <p>The duck said</p>
  <p>"Yes, dear."</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>'Til the very next day</p>
  <p>(Bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum)</p>
  <p>When the duck walked up to the corner store</p>
  <p>And he said to the woman, running the store</p>
  <p>"Hey! (Bum bum bum) got any grape chapstick?"</p>
  <p>"What?"</p>
  <p>"Got any grape chapstick?"</p>
  <p>"Actually we do</p>
  <p>But you don't have any money do you?"</p>
  <p>"Do you think you could...</p>
  <p>Do you think you could...</p>
  <p>Do you think you could... put it on my bill?"</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
  <p>(Waddle waddle waddle)</p>
  <p>Then he waddled away</p>
